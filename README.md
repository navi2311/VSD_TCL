- to tell the operating system which file we are running we have include
  ```
    #!/usr/bin/env tclsh

  this will tell we are running tcl script .to know the env in terminal use``` which env ```.

  Basically when we run ./myscript.tcl OS sees the above lines and run ``` /usr/bin/env tclsh myscript.tcl```
