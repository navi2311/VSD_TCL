  A matrix is a rectangular collection of cells, i.e. organized in rows and columns. Each cell contains exactly one value of arbitrary form. The cells in the matrix are addressed by pairs of integer numbers, with the first (left) number in the pair specifying the column and the second (right) number specifying the row the cell is in. These indices are counted from 0 upward. The special non-numeric index end refers to the last row or column in the matrix, depending on the context. Indices of the form end-number are counted from the end of the row or column, like they are for standard Tcl lists. Trying to access non-existing cells causes an error.
